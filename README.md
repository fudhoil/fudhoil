Starting from 2020, my journey into the world of web development began, and since then, I've passionately honed my skills in crafting exceptional websites. Embracing this newfound passion, I took the leap into my professional career as a full stack developer in 2021, specializing in JavaScript and PHP (native/frameworks).

<!-- Fuelled by a relentless pursuit of growth, I make it a personal commitment to stay abreast of the latest cutting-edge stacks and tools, dedicating time each day to expand my knowledge.

Continuing on the path of improvement, my goal remains to contribute actively to my code repositories. To achieve this, I strive to make a fresh (git) commit every week, whether it be on private or public repositories, ensuring consistent progress in my projects.

As I move forward in my career, I eagerly embrace new challenges and opportunities, eager to create innovative solutions and positively impact the digital landscape. The passion for web development and the drive for constant improvement propel me on this exciting journey. -->
