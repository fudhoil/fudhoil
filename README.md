## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### [Fudhoil](https://fudhoil.vercel.app)

Since 2020, I have been actively involved in crafting websites and subsequently embarked on my professional career in 2021 as a full stack developer, primarily focusing on JavaScript and PHP frameworks.

Consistently driven to enhance myself, I am committed to acquiring knowledge about the most cutting-edge and up-to-date stacks and tools on a daily basis.

Striving for continuous progress, I aim to make at least one new (git) commit every week in either private or public repositories.
